# face mask recognition for COVID-19
This repository contains the source code of face mask recoginition model. This model is built using a pre-trained convolutional neural network called vgg-16. 

## Dataset
the dataset used in this model is downloaded from Kaggle website. This dataset contains in total 7450. Half of them with_mask and the other half without_mask.
I configured the dataset so I divided into 3 folders
- train
- valid
- test

each of the 3 folders contains the 2 folders 
1. with_mask
2. without_mask
