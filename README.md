# face mask recognition for COVID-19
This repository contains the source code of face mask recoginition model. This model is built using a a keras built in model called vgg16. It is pre-trained convolutional neural network model. 

## Dataset
the dataset used in this model is downloaded from Kaggle website. This dataset contains in total 7450. Half of them with_mask and the other half without_mask.
I divided the dataset into 3 folders
- train
- valid
- test

each of the 3 folders contains the 2 folders 
1. with_mask
2. without_mask

## The objective of this project is:
To build a model that enable the computer to recognize individuals who are/are not following precaution of wearing face mask in public areas.
